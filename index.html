    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Coca-Cola was invented in 1886 by Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a pharmacist from Atlanta, Georgia. Originally formulated as a medicinal tonic, Coca-Cola quickly grew in popularity and evolved into the beverage we know and love today. The brand’s first marketing slogan, “Drink Coca-Cola,” was used in the late 19th century, marking the beginning of an era of advertising innovation for the brand.</p>
    <p>Throughout the 20th century, Coca-Cola expanded globally, becoming a household name and part of pop culture. In the 1920s, the brand introduced the iconic glass bottle, which became a symbol of the product and was later used as part of the logo. Coca-Cola’s global expansion was complemented by its introduction of new flavors and innovative marketing campaigns, making it one of the most successful and recognized brands worldwide.</p>
    <p>Today, Coca-Cola is a global leader in the beverage industry, offering more than just soft drinks. We now have a diverse portfolio that includes water, juices, teas, and energy drinks, with a continued focus on providing refreshing beverages to millions of people around the world.</p>
